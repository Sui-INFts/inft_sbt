# Overview
INFT (Intelligent NFT) is a next-generation Web3 protocol that transforms static NFTs into intelligent and interactive assets by integrating AI and blockchain. Unlike traditional NFTs, INFTs continuously learn, interact, and evolve based on user engagement. These NFTs go beyond digital collectibles and function as digital identities, interaction records, credit profiles, and more.

## Problem
* Traditional finance uses KYC, employment, income, and documentation to assess creditworthiness.
* DeFi is **pseudonymous** and **permissionless**, making it difficult to assess trust and credit.
* As **stablecoins** are adopted in real-world finance (real estate, car loans, commerce),
  there is an urgent need for **on-chain credit systems**.
* Without credit scoring, DeFi lending either requires overcollateralization or remains inaccessible to many users.

## Emerging Solutions
* **3Jane**: Partners with banks to offer undercollateralized loans using traditional credit scores.
* **Cred Protocol**: Assigns decentralized credit scores based on wallet transaction history.
* These are early examples of bridging **Web2 credit logic** into the **Web3 ecosystem**.

## Solution
* INFT issues **Soulbound Tokens (SBTs)** linked to user wallets.
* These tokens evolve by tracking:
  * **On-chain transaction history**
  * **AI-monitored tasks and engagement** (e.g., quiz completion, platform usage)
* Credit tiers are automatically assigned and updated via **smart contracts**.
* APIs enable **DeFi protocols** to access encrypted, real-time, and verifiable credit profiles.
